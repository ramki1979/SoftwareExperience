The goal is to have everything that I learned is documented w.r.t current & future technologies.

Want to spend daily 1~2 hours as a hobby, minimum 30 minutes on any technology once started & daily 2 technologies minimum.

Commit all important notes and learning here for future reference for myself and for others in case if its useful.
